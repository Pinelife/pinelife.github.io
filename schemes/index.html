			<h3>Great Ideas for Getting Rich</h3>
			<br/>
			<h4>Idea #1: NiceTube</h4>
			<p>A <i>nice</i> porn website. </p>
			<br/>
			
			<h4>Idea #2: A service that helps you cheat the Bechdel test</h4>
				<p>
				Are you sick of being berated by those smug feminists? Would you like to include a
				weird vignette in your film's credits just to shove it in their faces that, yes, actually, 
				your film about intergalactic sex pirates <i>does</i> include two women having a conversation about
				something other than a man? Then look no further: Pinelife is the premier provider of 
				short scripts featuring two women talking about everything except men. These non sequiturs are sure
				to puzzle and delight any audience - and best of all they mean that no on can ever accuse you of not 
				respecting women (until, of course, you are embroiled in a bitter divorce with your aging wife and 
				she reveals how you've been scamming on her little sister for literally <i>years</i> and then the backlash	
				against you will be even worse because people will be like, I thought you were an ally - you always created
				meaty, meaningful roles for women. But, still, pre-divorce and backlash you'll have years to bask in the
				public's adoration).

				<br/>
				INT. MUM'S HOUSE - MIDDAY - AUSTRALIA<br/>
				<br/>
				CHYRON: CHRISTMAS DAY, 2017<br/>
				<br/>
				A dining table heaves with a lavish lunch: dishes of meat steam, butter melts into mashed potato, 
				peas glisten, and bubbles ascend in glasses of champagne as MUM and ANGELICA glower at one other
				across the table. DAD has tuned his hearing aid to the cricket and is buttering a dinner roll in blissful
				ignorance.
			</p>
				<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				MUM
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				You're a whore and a liar and an idiot and a cheat.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>ANGELICA does not react.</p>
			<br/>
				<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				MUM
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				Pass the turkey.

			<p>ANGELICA does not react.</p>

				<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				MUM
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				Will you please pass the turkey?

						<br/>
			<p>ANGELICA does not react.</p>
			<br/>
			<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				MUM
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				You're a whore and a liar and an idiot and a cheat. And you look fat and -

			<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">

			<p class="script2">
				Mum, we have chicken and pork and beef and duck and deer. You know we don't have any fucking turkey.

			<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				ANGELICA
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				Right.
			</p>
						<br/>
			<p>
				Peas fly as ANGELICA launches herself across the lunch table and begins to throttle MUM, bashing MUM's 
				head on the tiled floor as if she were a baby. DAD has fallen asleep in his roast lunch. 
				ANGELICA only lets go once it becomes clear that MUM is going to take a while to die via strangulation.
			</p>
						<br/>
			<p style="text-align:center" class="indented">
				ANGELICA
			</p>
			<p class="script2">
				If you ever try to talk to me about turkeys again I'll kill you.
			</p>
						<br/>
			<p>
				MUM lies on the floor, massaging her throat. Angelica walks outside.<br/>
							<br/>
				<br/>
				EXT. BACK PORCH OF MUM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - AUSTRALIA<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				ANGELICA surveys the smouldering wreck of the family turkey farm. To the edge of the horizon, all we
				see is ash and bone and the crumbling remains of acres of turkey sheds.
