<h3><a href = "www.missionmodern.com.au">Mission Modern</a></h3>

<p>Mission Modern is a beautiful salon style store rather than a traditional shop - it's like walking into a 
  mid-century modern living room. In the store you'll find collectibles, homewares, books on design, and a set of the 
  iconic original Tessa T3 lounge chairs. The store has stylish new clothes as well as some vintage fashion and hand made shoes. 
	All of the new pieces are made in Melbourne by local artisans. </p>

<p>Mission Modern is committed to slow makers and is full of classic pieces and timeless style.</p>
