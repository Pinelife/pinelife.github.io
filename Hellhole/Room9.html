    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into your house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You hit on Chen Li at a house party and lured him back to your lair (actually just your bedroom) where you kissed him and touched 
him in a mostly PG way</li>
  </br>
<li>He gave you herpes - and perhaps also superpowers</li>
  </br>
<li>To test the extent of your superpowers, you've decided to do something heroic</li>

   </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<h3>Bludblow: Fall of the Dawn of the Rise of the Woman of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Strap yourself in because this is an intercoursingly good story: you want to try something genuinely heroic so you soak your 
  woollen clothes in water and create a bot which notifies you whenever a Melbourne news Twitter 
  account tweets anything from the following list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fire</li>
    <li>Inferno</li>
    <li>Vesuvius 2.0</li>
    <li>... in scenes reminiscent of the underrated 1991 movie <i>Backdraft</i>...</li>
    <li>... more firery and dramatic than when the Globe Theatre burnt down in 1613...</li>
    <li>... burning senasation that could only be caused by skin literally being on fire...</li>
</ul>
<p>So you know about every fire worth knowing about in Melbourne: now it's just a matter of biding your time, waiting for the perfect one to drop in on.
With modern heat and smoke detectors, sprinklers and the recent trend away from cremation, people are getting better at leaving their homes
  before fire can kill or partially incinerate them. These are not easy times to be a hero. Few people require saving.

  When you do finally decide to make your move, your car won't start so you have to take the bus to the apartment fire. To preserve your anonymity, 
  you're wearing an eye mask you crafted by cutting eye holes in an old soccer sock. You're also wearing a costume of soaking wet merino
  wool thermals because you think you read one time about how wool doesn't burn. Every step you take squelches as your wet  
  clothes relieve themselves of water. You ruin the bus seat with your sodden thermals plus you had to fare evade since your costume has 
  no pocket for your Myki. When you get off the bus you set off at a steady trot in the direction of the towering inferno in the 
  distance. It's a gate to Oblivion: the night sky is cracked with red, smoke curls around the stars, birds flee in terror. It's a gate to
  Fallujah: children gawp, women weep and wail, men in uniforms perspire and move around in groups. No one pays attention to the girl 
  lumbering past them in wet thermals.
</p>
<p>
  You can feel the heat on your face from a block away. This is no joke. The fire burns hot and tall in the night: it stinks of a 
  million pieces of melted Tupperwear, the incinerated hair of a thousand dolls, the contents of a hundred freezers cooked instantly by heat 
  hotter than any oven. A woman stranded on the 11th floor uses bed sheets and a bucket to lower her houseplants to safety.
  Outside the building's glowing radius, reporters crowd in the shadows. None of them wear ties or long sleeved 
  shirts. None of them look at the fire. Make-up women rumple reporters' hair and smudge ash on their cheeks so when they shed a single sorrowful tear it'll look 
  spectacular on camera. The fire marshal has divided displaced residents into groups based on their particular greivance: women whose 
  babies/cats/boyfriends/vibrators/un-backed-up manuscripts are stuck in the building and possibly being consumed by flames 
  at this very moment, people who left in such haste they forgot to grab a phone charger, and anyone who's worried the fire may be 
  their fault because they left their box of illegal fireworks beside a faulty blow torch. This is the fall of Christendom and thousands
  of souls are at stake: you're gonna do your best to save a a few.
</p>
  <p>
  You confidently dip under the safety tape. A woman separates herself from the group of grieving women and reaches over the tape
    to grab the saggy elbow of your thermals. She is cartoonish in her desperation and fear: huge eyes, pink slippers, very pregnant, 
    willing to place her faith in an unlikely hero. 
</p>    
    <p>
      She <strike>says</strike> <strike>wails</strike> pleads: <span style="color:blue;">my baby is still in there.</span>
</p>
<p class="lauria">
      Don't worry, ma'am, I will save your precious child from this towering inferno.
      </p>
<p>
      You turn to leave, swinging your leg out for a purposeful stride, when she asks: <span style="color:blue;">don't you need to know the apartment number?</span>
      </p>
  <p class="lauria">
      Oh yeah.<br/> 
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      205.<br/>
      </p>
    <p class="lauria">
      Too easy.<br/>
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      That's the 20th floor - not the second.<br/>
      </p>
      <p class="lauria">
      I can handle it.<br/>
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      Be careful!
</p>
        <p class="lauria">
          No <i>duh</i>, ma'am.
</p>
<p>
Your thermals are steaming before you even get through the front door. You call the elevator. When 
  the doors creak open, smoke gasps out and you hear the ominous groaning of metal. Better take the stairs.

  <p>As you climb higher, the hand railing to guide you up the stairs begins to glows orange.</p> 
<p>
  It is very hot. The fire stairs are mostly smoke free but the windows to each fire door reveal a roving set of hellscapes:
  carpets completely aflame, valuables dumped in hallways by people who abandoned photo albums and laptops to flee faster. 
  
    <br/>
The building - it’s burning, but don’t worry: everything’s gonna be alright. Listen, self: you’re okay, everything will be alright. Nothing good gets 
  away. It will be okay. Don’t worry if it’s burning: you’re okay. It’s only a fire, it’s just a baby, there are lots like it. Like I 
  said just before, nothing good gets away. Nothing good gets away. Read this again. You’re trying, that counts for something, Allison. 
  Allison, please don’t be sad if the baby is burnt by the time you get there. Everything’s gonna be alright. Nothing good gets away.</p>

Linoleum turns to liquid under your feet.

 Sorry: your skin will heal in time — just minor burns. Curious that your skin responded to the flames at all with such great thermals. Um. 
  Even with the stunning quantity of water your eyebrows can hold after a shower, it was not enough to keep you safe in that apartment. 
  And now, your whole body has become a scab. There is thick scentless oil buried in you.
