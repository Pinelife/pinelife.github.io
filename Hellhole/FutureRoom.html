<h3>I Pretended to have AIDS for You</h3>
<p>
Finally, we got the skinny— there are no superheroes or masked crime fighters in Melbourne. Everything is average.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Hogtied </h3>

Don’t wanna bite me, fiend. I am chock full of blood diseases. You don’t want them in your mouth. <br/>
“What?” inquires Bad Man #1<br/>
I am the norm now, I am Bludblow. I’m magnificent in red, I’m a super villain after your heart — diseased and bored, I’m becoming a better 
person, a Muslim MILF, a Mormon mom: go ahead, call me a woman. <br/>
 “Shut up,” suggests Bad Man #1. <br/>
“Yeah,” advises Bad Man #2.<br/>
Listen here — I gotta warn you: I do mean to do harm. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

	So that tomorrow the headlines would read, <i>Bludblow to Retire</i>? And then, 15 years later, <i>Bludblow: Whatever Happened to The 
	Woman After Your Heart?</i>

<p>
	Even at your worst I would still totally have done you: I wanted to fuck you so badly. But, wow: 
	you really are dead right now. Oh wow. I’ve done the wrong thing here. Haven’t I? Oh boy. I don’t know — I’d still kiss you. 
	You look so good, even with my footprints on your face.
