    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You've ruined your housemate's relationship</li>
</br>
<li>Some time in the future...</li>
</ul>

Finally, we got the skinny— there are no superheroes or masked crime fighters in Melbourne. Everything is average.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t wanna bite me, fiend. I am chock full of blood diseases. You don’t want them in your mouth. <br/>
“What?” inquires Bad Man #1<br/>
I am the norm now, I am Bludblow. I’m magnificent in red, I’m a super villain after your heart — diseased and bored, I’m becoming a better 
person, a Muslim MILF, a Mormon mom: go ahead, call me a woman. <br/>
 “Shut up,” suggests Bad Man #1. <br/>
“Yeah,” advises Bad Man #2.<br/>
Listen here, fuckwits — I gotta warn you: I do mean to do harm. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So you can wake up in the backseat of a car, and be much poorer but be grateful — grateful that you are not trussed up in the trunk.

Shut the fuck up, asshole.<br/>
