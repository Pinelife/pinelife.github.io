<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>You wish.</p>
 <p>What kind of moat could possibly accomodate sharks <i>and</i> crocodiles? 
 (Unless of course we're dealing with some kind of world-first estuarine moat which keeps the water temperate and salty enough to please both 
 saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks - two species which famously fair well in both salt and fresh water.)</p>

<p>Anyway, just to give you an idea of what you're getting into: this is an ultraviolent rom com. You play a young woman who 
 writes a relationship advice blog. What's the one problem she can't solve? Finding a man (and also disposing of a body). Will 
 there be sharks and castles somewhere down the line? Not sure yet but stay tuned to find out.</p>

<p>  
It's 9pm on a Friday: you are heading to a house party in a few hours. As per always, you've shaved your entire body (except your head), 
 you're wearing your most binding clothes and are finishing your makeup in your room while drinking a cocktail of your own invention: a Moscow Goatfuck.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Moscow Goatfuck Recipe</h3
<li>
  <ul>Lime wedge</ul>
  <ul>1 cup vodka</ul>
  <ul>Tablespoon fresh lime juice</ul>
  <ul>1/2 cup ginger beer</ul>
  <ul>(Pro tip: it's just a regular Moscow Mule but with four times the vodka.)</ul>
</li>
<br/>
<p>The party started at 8:30pm but you signed a blood oath with Satan a few years ago promising you'd never get to a party before 11pm 
(it's a long story but the gist is this: in your Faustian bargain, Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, 
 most interesting girl at any party you go to, but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is 
 already tanked so your smartness/funniness/interestingness is wasted). How do you want to pass the time before you can go to the party?</p>
<br/>
<p>Do you want to <a href="Room2.html">check out your relationship advice blog <b>FuckLyf</b></a> or do you want to <a href="Room3.html">pick a petty fight with your housemate Ben?</a></p>
