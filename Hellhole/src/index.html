<p>You are standing in front of a dilapidated castle: you see ivy, gargoyles, shadowy figures peering through broken windows - it's your 
  standard deathtrap. 
</p>
<p>
  The castle is surrounded by a moat filled with <b>sharks and crocodiles</b> - they seem to be busily engaged in some 
  kind of internecine interspecies warfare but might take a break from chomping each other to have a go at you.</p>
