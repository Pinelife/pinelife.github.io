    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You've ruined your housemate's relationship and now ((I have no idea where to take this side of the story))</li>
</ul>
    </p>

<p>
Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road waiting for 11pm.

<p>
	Rough plans:
	<ul>
		<li>I got nothing... for now.</li>
		<li>Could possibly go the cousin terror route?</li>
		<li>Dad across the street</li>
</ul>
