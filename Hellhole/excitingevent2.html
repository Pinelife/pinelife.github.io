<h3>Exciting Event #2: I Wanna Be Patronised</h3>

<p>
  Standing in the darkened hallway beside your parents' bedroom, you concentrate all your powers on listening.
  Through the door you hear your dad whisper: baby, be gentle. I've never done this before.<br/>
  <br/>
  The sound of a girl's chuckle.<br/>
  <br/>
  You imagine you can hear intense eye contact and blood moving at haste around their bodies. In the wine dark night, you 
lean your head against the plasterboard and imagine the terrible things occurring on the other side of the wall:
 wet, white, wonderful - your dream girl is defiling your dad.
 </p>
<p>
  Here's some background: as a novelty during school soccer practice a few months ago, they let you play against the girls' team. She 
marked you near her team's goal and said she was going to wear you like a glove which, at the time, you thought was insanely 
sexy but later learned was standard fare for sporting shit talk when your uncle said it to you during a game of footy over 
Christmas. Anyway, for most of the game her forearm was pressed up against your chest and when her ponytail whipped you in the face
 you smelt the artificial tropical paradise of her conditioner. It's the closest you'd ever been to a woman besides that time your mum
  gave birth to you. At the end of the game she bent over to pull up her socks and smiled as she looked back at you between her 
  legs.
</p> 
<p>
 During homeroom the following morning, you looked up her name in the school email directory and composed a strong opener, a message whose
  beauty and profundity will echo through time, an email which will one day be studied by English undergrads for the claity and 
  sensitivity of its prose. This is truly the stuff of teenaged girls' dreams, the kind of swooning romance young women crave, 
  something they'll commit to memory and scrawl in their diaries in loopy, dreamy script. It read:</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  Yo Esther <br/>
  <br/>
  What's up?<br/>
  <br/>
  Regards,<br/>
  Josh<br/>
</p>
<p>
  You tortured yourself over whether to sign off with 'warm regards' or 'kind regards' but decided to play it cool and leave it
  as just 'regards.'
</p>
<p>
  She takes three days to reply. If sitcoms have taught you anything, it's that anyone who goes to the effort of taking
three days to reply to an email is probably very interested in you. You screenshot the notification on your phone's lock
  screen so, at your engagment party in five years' time, you can project the image on the wall behind you while you give
 a speech about how you knew, right from the start, that she was the girl for you. Her response read:
 </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  hey faggot - i dont date 15 year olds
</p>
<p>
  Not ideal but while you've got her hot, you respond right away:
</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
Fine, bitch, kick rocks.
</p>
<p>The following day you skipped soccer practice and went to the crusty old pitch where the girls practice. Ponytails swish, socks slump, sweat 
gathers under boobs and trickles down torsos. As you unfolded your deckcahir, the girls stopped to watch. You kicked back, drained a can 
of grape Fanta and lit a cigarette. You were a vision of coolness. One final touch: you pulled out a copy of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>.
  The girls gasped. You ashed your cigarette on their oval and cracked the book's spine. Page one: "If you really want to hear about it,
the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, an what my lousy childhood was like, and how..." 
</p>
<p>You imagined that the sound of panties hitting the dusty old pitch was audible even for a listener sitting 3000m away from the pitch.
For the next 50 minutes it killed you, but you kept reading that terrible book. Sports bras strained. Ponytails swished. 
Balls were kicked with wild imprecision. Cheeks flushed. Shoelaces undid themselves. Puberty progressed.
</p>
<p>
As the session ended, you glanced up from behind your Aviators to see what they were doing. Girls were extracting shinguards from their 
socks and pulling off their boots. Esther, the only girl worth caring about, scratched a mosquito bite on her elbow as she 
 regarded you with powerful indifference.
</p>
<p>
  Self-consciously, you turned to a page.
</p>
