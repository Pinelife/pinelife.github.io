    <b>The Story So Far...</b>

    <ul>

      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>

      </br>

  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>

  </br>

 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>

  </br>

<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>

  </br>

<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>

<br/>

<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>

  </br>

<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>

  </br>

<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>

</br>

<li>You've ruined your housemate's relationship and went out to drink alone</li>

<li>Your small business flourishes but you're drunk and alone in a car park</li>

</ul>

    </p>
<p>The Stump Hotel's neon sign (a letching beaver biting seductively into a pirate's wooden leg) reflects in the muddy carpark.</p>

<p>
You spot the portable smoke machine beside your car and ready yourself for some bullshit. 
Fake smoke swirls excitedly as Satan emerges from behind your car, Hawaiian shirt unbuttoned to his navel, smiling goofily: 
stupidly handsome, beatific, blonde, chiseled, he's standing on two dainty cloven hooves - really more deerlike than caprine. 
</p>
<h3>I Want to go Through Hell for You</h3>
<p>You never talk to me! You only summon me when you need something, I'm not a genie, you can't just call on me to grant wishes -</p>
<p>Dude, you call that a wish? You've ruined drinking and parties and bars for me. They were like the only thing I even enjoyed. Now 
I never know -</p>
<p>Don't yell at me, Allison, I love you.</p>
<p>Don't fucking speak to me like that or I'll send you back.</p>
<p>I really do love you.</p>
<p>Right. I told you to take me serious.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
To begin the process of banishing Satan back to Hell, you pull off the pyjama shirt you've been wearing all day to reveal the tattoo below
your right breast. You lick your thumb and run it along the words: Daddy's Angel. Satan is sucked through a portal
in his own belly button. All that's left is hoof prints in the mud of the car park.

<p>
To summon Satan, you need to activate your tattoo. If tattoo activation reminds readers of the bad guys from a famous YA story,
let that tell them something about how that author achieved her success. The bargain J.K. Rowling struck was that she would be famous and 
successful beyond her wildest dreams, but that she would desecrate her legacy by being an idiot on Twitter. Satan made his offer in 1996,
long before Twitter even existed, so it sounded reasonable to Ms. Rowling at the time. When Twitter launched a decade later, she felt 
herself inexorably drawn to the platform: after all, she was an internationally beloved author, year after year she outsold the Bible,
world leaders read her books to their children every night, she was the most popular single mum since Princess Diana - surely people 
would want to know what she thought about foreign politics and the latest scandal surrounding YouTube personalities.

<p>As you pull out of the car park, the trashed remains of the smoke machine drag underneath your car.</p>
