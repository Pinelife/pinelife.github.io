<p>
I shaved for you.<br/>
<br/>
I dragged a razor blade along every bit of my skin, neck-down.<br/>
<br/>
But you feel meh or tired or not super. <br/>
<br/>
So sure - 
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think any dude understands the pain of shaving for nothing. That - more than anything - makes girls feel so stupid and sad.
