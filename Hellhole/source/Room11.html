    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You ruined your housemate's relationship</li>
<li>You summoned your old pal Satan to help cure your coldsores</li>
<li>Now, sans visible signs of herpes, you can go out</li>
</ul>
    </p>

<p>
Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road waiting for 11pm. 	
</p>
<p>
	Rough plans:
		<ul>
<li>Recap curse #1: Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, most interesting girl at any party you go to, 
	but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is already tanked so your 
	smartness/funniness/interestingness is wasted </li>
	<li>None of the drunk people there appreciate your cleverness or cuteness</li>
	<li>But then: a boy who doesn't drink</li>
	<li>You feel your liver turn to ash (not literally)</li>
	<li>For our protagonist who was just infected: a horrible plague spreads around the bar, killing every first 
	born son.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	She uses vodka mixed with beer. It’s super effective!<br/>
	And he rock hard stomached himself so that, um, so that -  <br/>
	And I’ll hex your girlfriend. I’ll give her consumption. <br/>
