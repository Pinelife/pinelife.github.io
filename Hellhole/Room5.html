<h3>It's That Time of Night :(</h3>
<p>When you get home, Ben is lying on the couch trying to act like he hasn't just been watching <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>. 
	He pretends not to see you. You head for the kitchen to grab a snack - you turn all the lights on, slam cupboards, 
	and leave the fridge door ajar so it beeps. Ben pretends not 
	to hear anything. You retreat to your room with a huge sack of potato chips.</p>
<p>
You leave the blinds open as you wriggle out of your clothes. The skirt was so binding that it has cut pink marks into your waist. 
  You get into bed naked with your bag of chips. Your laptop has been running ceaselessly since Tuesday morning and has left a warm spot in 
  your bed where a boyfriend is supposed to go. You fire up a Ken Burns documentary. The sound of chip mastication inside your own head is 
  so loud that you can't hear anything of the show. 
</p>
<p>
When you wake up, the credits for the final episode in the documentary series are rolling up the screen. Your bed is filled with 
  crushed chips. Seeing the wreckage from last night's binge you swear to yourself that you will only eat shredded lettuce for the next 
	three days. You shut the lid of your laptop and feel around in the blankets and shards of potato chips for your phone.</p>

<p>For the second time this week you snoop through Chen Li's Instagram. He created the account three years ago, posted five pictues
  and then obviously got sick of it and never posted again. The photos have cancer filters and are shockingly dull: his attempt at
  cooking bolognese, a super close-up of his dog's face, a sunrise (or possibly a sunset), a vaguely amusing numberplate, and a
  picture of him looking appreciatively at a huge rack of ribs. The photos are bad and boring but you like them because they're his. His
	Instagram profile picture is a bathroom mirror selfie. Bathroom bench in disarray. Toilet seat up. It's a stupid photo but you sometimes think about it when you masturbate.</p>

<p>Time to get up. What do you want to do today? You can devote yourself to self improvement by <a href = "Room7.html">working on FuckLyf</a> or you can risk it all and jump to <a href ="excitingevent1.html">a contextless exciting event</a> (who knows what it'll be - 
a high impact and horrifyingly graphic sex scene complete with crude MS Paint illustrations? A terrifying and wildly inaccurate portrait of postpartum depression?). </p>
