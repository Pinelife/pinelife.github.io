		<h3>Exciting Event #3: Honeypottin' Hitler</h3>

<p>
On a particularly wintery evening in Krakow, two men stumble down a cobblestoned street. 
  They are completely loaded: the condensation in their exhaled breath is 99% wine, when they kiss 
  their wives good morning in a few hours they will still taste of wine. Possibly the taste of wine will never leave their mouths. 
It's not really any of our business anyway.
</p>
<p>
 The street is amlost perfectly dark: moonlight reflects off the raw sewage which has collected in the gutters, the smoke from 
   dying fireplaces across the city curls into the night sky. One of the men has tied his coat around his neck like a cape and
  prances down the street while his companion uses a wine bottle to blow out a poor approximation of a folk jig.
