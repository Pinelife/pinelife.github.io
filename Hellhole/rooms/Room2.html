    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>

<p>You write under the name Lauria Moria. Your website FuckLyf typically attracts ~100,000 unique visitors per month which earns you around $100/month in ad revenue. This isn't even enough to cover a week's worth of beer and fried chicken expenses
  so in conjuntion with your relationship advice posts, you offer a highly sought after service - nudes assessments. For $10 per image 
  or $15 per video, users can submit nudes to you and receive honest and constructive feedback on which parts of their bodies to 
  highlight/Photoshop, tips for lighting and suggested angles. Naturally this has degenerated into men sending you photos of their dicks
  and you copy/pasting an email full of compliments.</p>

<p>You also run a scam using Amazon. On your website you advertise your Amazon wishlist - people can browse the list and buy things
  for you as gifts. When you first started doing this, your wishlist included normal things like books, muesli bars, and toilet paper. 
  But you found that no one was interested in buying these things for you. Now you have overhauled your wishlist so it includes 10L vats 
  of personal lubricant, handcuffs, uncomfortable underwear, leather harnesses, Lolita outfits, etc. People love buying these things for 
  you. When you receive these items in the mail, you return them to Amazon to receive credit on your account which you then use to buy 
  household essentials like dish soap, tinned soup, and socks. It might be worth mentioning at this point that you are a very attractive young woman. You look like someone out of an ad for expensive coffee: black hair, dark eyes, puffy lips, 
  warm skin, fully functional organs, etc. This is why men want to buy you vats of lubricant.</p>

<p>So your website is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but you are serious about giving people genuine advice on how to have happy, 
  healthy relationships. As a 24 year old who has never been in a serious relationship, you aren't exactly qualified to give this 
  advice, but people seem to listen anyway.</p>

  Dear Lauria,<br/>
  <br/>
  My wife has found another guy. We've been together 9 years, since I was 15. Married 5 years. She's refused to go to couples' counseling and wants me gone. I'm currently living in her 
  home country, my in-laws have known about this guy for 6 months and seem to think the divorce is final so they've started treating me 
  like shit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">I've been told if I don't sign the divorce papers I'll be deported. I have no family back in my country and I sold everything I owned 
  to move to her country to be with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">I just need to know: does it ever get any easier? I honestly want to throw myself of a fucking cliff. To have someone I still love 
  and care about go from saying I love you to saying that I am a worthless piece of shit, that she never loved me. She lied about 
  this guy and blocked him on my Facebook because he was 'just a friend' and I would 'get the wrong idea.' How in the living fuck do 
  I keep myself together? Will I ever get better? What the fuck can I do to cope with all of this?

  Hi Absolute Loser, <br/>
   <br/>
  Find an attorney and get some legal advice. It will get better. For what it's worth, the reason she is saying you are worthless and 
  she never loved you is because she needs an excuse for how she has treated you. I'm sure it's not true: she knows it's not true, but 
  it's the only way she can save face. Otherwise she just looks like a giant flake to her family.
  I'm sure there's no possible way you aren't going to take it personally, but don't take everything at face value and use it to beat yourself up. 
  She's trying to put you down to make herself look better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">It's unfortunate but when you pair up so young, you aren't the person you will mature to be eventually. You are now seeing what kind of 
  person she turned out to be. I promise there is someone out there who won't treat you like shit and throw you away like so much trash.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">You have rights, find out what they are legally, and figure out how to put your life back together again. Might not be a bad idea to 
  get some counseling to help you cope. But until then just take it one day at a time, figure out what you need to take care of yourself.
  And keep putting one foot in front of the other until you feel better and can take a big look around and see that she was not worth it.</p>
<br/>
<p>Phew, that was emotionally taxing. What do you want to do now? You can <a href="Room4.html">go to the party</a> or <a href="Room3.html">pick a petty fight with your house mate Ben</a>.</p>
