<h3>Bludblow: Fall of the Dawn of the Rise of the Woman of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regretting the time you consorted with Satan and the elaborate blood ritual you performed together (about which more below)
you resolve to atone by doing something genuinely heroic. You soak your woollen clothes in water and create a bot which 
notifies you whenever a Melbourne news Twitter account tweets anything from the following list:</p>
<p>
    - Fire<br/>
	<br/>
    - Inferno<br/>
	<br/>
    - Vesuvius 2.0<br/>
	<br/>
    - ... in scenes reminiscent of the underrated 1991 movie <i>Backdraft</i>...<br/>
	<br/>
    - ... more firery and dramatic than when the Globe Theatre burnt down in 1613...<br/>
	<br/>
    - ... burning senasation that could only be caused by skin literally being on fire...
</p>
<p>So you know about every fire worth knowing about in Melbourne: now it's just a matter of biding your time, waiting for the perfect one to drop in on.
With modern heat and smoke detectors, sprinklers and the recent trend away from cremation, people are getting better at leaving their homes
  before fire can kill or partially incinerate them. These are not easy times to be a hero. Few people require saving.
</p>
<p>For those sickos in the audience who wanna know more about the blood play you shared with Satan, here are the details:
as part of your bargain, Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, most interesting girl at any party you go
to - but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is already drunk and immune to things like 
cleverness, so you receive no discernible performance enhancement. Even Satan isn't totally clear on how this deal is actually enforced 
on Earth: as soon as you decide to go to a party, do more beautiful/funny/smart women decide not to go? Do they all leave at 10:55pm 
before you cross the threshold? Do they lose points as you enter? Do you receive some kind of buff?<br/>
	<br/>
To seal this deal, Satan made you perform an elaborate and weirdly erotic blood oath routine with him which involved slicing the soles 
of your feet, licking the blood, spitting it into each others mouths, and then spitting the mingled blood and saliva back into the foot 
wound. He said he saw it on RedTub and found it hot but his girlfriend wouldn't try it out with him.
For those not in the know, RedTub is the sister site to RedTube. RedTub's primary market is vampires and their content focuses almost 
exclusively on blood play, about which let us say no more because it is dark and unpleasant (yes, kinkshame).</p>

  9:13pm om a Wednesday on you're on a bus en route to an apartment fire. To preserve your anonymity, 
  you're wearing an eye mask you crafted by cutting eye holes in an old soccer sock. You're also wearing a costume of soaking wet merino
  wool thermals because you think you read one time about how wool doesn't burn. Every step you take squelches as your   
  clothes relieve themselves of water. You ruin the bus seat with your sodden thermals plus you had to fare evade since your costume has 
  no pocket for your Myki. When you get off the bus you set off at a steady trot in the direction of the towering inferno in the 
  distance. It's a gate to Oblivion: the night sky is cracked with red, smoke curls around the stars, birds flee in terror. It's a gate to
  Fallujah: children gawp, women weep and wail, men in uniforms perspire and move around in groups. No one pays attention to the girl 
  lumbering past them in wet thermals.
</p>
<p>
  You can feel the heat on your face from a block away. This is no joke. The fire burns hot and tall in the night: it stinks of a 
  million pieces of melted Tupperwear, the incinerated hair of a thousand dolls, the contents of a hundred freezers cooked instantly by heat 
  hotter than any oven. A woman stranded on the 11th floor uses bed sheets and a bucket to lower her houseplants to safety.
  Outside the building's glowing radius, reporters crowd in the shadows. None of them wear ties or long sleeved 
  shirts. None of them look at the fire. Make-up women rumple reporters' hair and smudge ash on their cheeks so when they shed a single sorrowful tear it'll look 
  spectacular on camera. The fire marshall has divided displaced residents into groups based on their particular greivance: women whose 
  babies/cats/boyfriends/vibrators/un-backed-up manuscripts are stuck in the building and possibly being consumed by flames 
  at this very moment, people who left in such haste they forgot to grab a phone charger, and anyone who's worried the fire may be 
  their fault because they left their box of illegal fireworks beside a faulty blow torch. This is the fall of Christendom and thousands
  of souls are at stake: you're gonna do your best to save a a few.
</p>
  <p>
  You confidently dip under the safety tape. A woman separates herself from the group of grieving women and reaches over the tape
    to grab the saggy elbow of your thermals. She is cartoonish in her fear: huge eyes, pink slippers, very pregnant, 
    willing to place her faith in an unlikely hero. 
</p>    
    <p>
      She pleads: <span style="color:blue;">my baby is still in there.</span>
</p>
<p class="lauria">
      Don't worry ma'am, I will save your precious child from this towering inferno.
      </p>
<p>
      You turn to leave, then she asks: <span style="color:blue;">don't you need to know the apartment number?</span>
      </p>
  <p class="lauria">
      Oh yeah.<br/> 
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      205.<br/>
      </p>
    <p class="lauria">
      Too easy.<br/>
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      That's the 20th floor - not the second.<br/>
      </p>
      <p class="lauria">
      I can handle it.<br/>
      </p>
<p style="color:blue;">
      Be careful.
</p>
        <p class="lauria">
          No duh, ma'am.
</p>
<p>
Your thermals are steaming before you even get through the front door. You call the elevator. When 
  the doors creak open, smoke gasps out and you hear the ominous groaning of metal. Better take the stairs.
  </p>

<p>
  <p>As you climb, the window in each fire door reveals a roving set of hellscapes: carpets completely aflame, valuables dumped in 
hallways by people who abandoned photo albums and parakeets to flee faster. It's a long way up. The floors aren't numbered and you 
lose count as you climb. Occasionally you stop for a break, sitting on the warm metal steps and sucking water from the sleeve of your 
thermals. You wheeze and perspire and suffer. You pass a fireman as he is descending. 
</p>
<p style="color:red;">Don't go up there, babe.</p>
<p>You lean on the hand railing and look up at him.</p>
<p style="color:red;">Whatever you left behind, you can buy a new one. There's nothing left up there. Please come down with me.</p>
<p>You shake your head and carry on. When you look back, you see the smoke close around him like a hug.</p>
<h3>Like Tears in Sweat</h3>
<p>
Your inner monologue runs strong: the building - it’s burning, but don’t worry: everything’s gonna be alright. Listen, Allison: you’re okay, everything will be alright. Nothing good gets 
  away. It will be okay. Don’t worry if it’s burning: you’re okay. It’s only a fire, it’s just a baby, there are lots like it. Nothing good gets away. 
Say it again. Nothing good gets away. You’re trying, that counts for something, Allison. 
  Allison, please don’t be sad if the baby is burnt by the time you get there. Everything’s gonna be alright. Nothing good gets away.</p>
<br/>
<p>
As you walk through the front door of apartment 205, you experience all the typical
	symptoms of smoke inhalation:<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>Pleasingly flushed cheeks</li>
		<li>Hoarse and sexy voice from the burning sensation in your throat</li>
		<li>Luminous, sparkling eyes due to the smoke assailing the delicate membrane which separates the white of your
		eye from the rest of the universe</li>
		<li>A hacking and aesthetically displeasing coughing up of sooty miasma</li>
</ul></p>
	<p>
Readers who may doubt the veracity of this narrative can acquanit themselves with the symptoms of smoke inhalation
 by searching "smoke inhalation symptoms" in their search engine of choice.
</p>
<p>In the kitchen, the linoleum floor turns to liquid under your feet. Through the gloom, a laptop screen glows. Your ears are dead 
from the sound of smoke alarms but you call out anyway: <span class="lauria">Is anyone here?</span> You venture further in. 
<span class="lauria">My name is Bludblow. I'm here to rescue you.</span> You find a nursery: the wallpaper features a motif of animals prancing dementedly in an infinte loop around 
the room. A  partially contstructed crib leans against the wall. No one there. In the next room, a nighlight brightens the
neighbouring smoke. A kid-sized bed is empty in the corner. You call out again: <span class="lauria">Hello?</span>  
</p>
<p>Running your hand along the hallway walls, you use your phone's screen to guide you through the smoke. In the master bedroom, a lump 
disturbs the linens. A little boy has put himself to bed in his parents room: he is tiny in the vastness of their bed. You 
	stroke his forearm and whisper:</p>
<p class="lauria">Hey kiddo.</p>
<p>The lump, the little boy, doesn't move. He is still warm as you scoop him up, but he looks very grey through the smoke. He has
wet himself.
</p>
<p>
Running back down the stairs two at a time, the kid's head lols senselessly but tou take it as a sign of life that crystal beads of sweat 
have appeared on his forehead. His lips are puckered cherubically. It is now literally impossibly hot: concrete vapourises beneath your feet,
the ends of your hairs singe from mere contact with the air, the banister in the fire escape has melted and follows you down the stairs in 
a stream of molten metal. This is a fire which defies what science knows about fires.
</p>
<p>As you stumble out the front of the apartment building, you are mobbed by journalists </p>
<p class="lauria">Lady, please, will you dial it back?</p>
<p style="color:blue;">Give me my baby, I -</p>
<p class="lauria">Fine, bitch, have his corpse.</p>
