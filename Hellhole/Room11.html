      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>

  </br>

<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You ruined your housemate's relationship</li>
<li>You summoned your old pal Satan to help cure your coldsores</li>
<li>Now, sans visible signs of herpes, you can go out</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road waiting for 11pm. 	
</p>
<p>
	Recap curse #1:
	None of the drunk people there appreciate your cleverness or cuteness
	But then: a boy who doesn't drink
	You feel your liver turn to ash
