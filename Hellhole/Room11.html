    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You ruined your housemate's relationship</li>
</br>
<li>You summoned your old pal Satan to help cure your coldsores</li>
</br>
<li>Now, sans visible signs of herpes, you can go out</li>
</ul>

Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road waiting for 11pm. 	
</p>
<h3>Satanic Bargains Scorecard:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, most interesting girl at any party you go to, 
		but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is already tanked meaning you receive no
		discernible performance enhancement.
			<ul>	<li>Even Satan isn't totally clear on how this deal is actually enforced on Earth: as soon as you decide to go to a party, 
				do more beautiful/funny/smart women decide <i>not</i> to go? Do they all leave at 10:55pm before
				you cross the threshold? Do they lose points as you enter? Do you receive some kind of buff?</li>
				<li>It's possibly also interesting to note that with this first deal Satan made you perform an 
				elaborate and weirdly erotic blood oath routine with him which involved slicing the soles of your feet,
				 licking the blood, spitting it into each others mouths, and then spitting the mingled blood and saliva back
					into the foot wound. He said he saw it on RedTub and thought it seemed cool.</li>
				<ul><li>RedTub is the less-popular sister site to RedTube. RedTub focuses mostly blood play, about which
				let us say no more because it is dark and unpleasant (yes, kinkshame).</li>
				</ul></ul>
