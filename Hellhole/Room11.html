  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>

<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You ruined your housemate's relationship</li>
</br>
<li>You summoned your old pal Satan to help cure your coldsores</li>

Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road waiting for 11pm. 	
</p>
<h3>Satanic Bargains Scorecard:</h3>
<p><b>BARGAIN #1</b>: Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, most interesting girl at any party you go to 
- but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is already drunk and immune to things like 
cleverness, so  you receive no discernible performance enhancement. Even Satan isn't totally clear on how this deal is 
actually enforced on Earth: as soon as you decide to go to a party, do more beautiful/funny/smart women decide <i>not</i> 
to go? Do they all leave at 10:55pm before you cross the threshold? Do they lose points as you enter? Do you receive 
some kind of buff?</p>
<p>
It's possibly interesting to note that with this first deal Satan made you perform an 
elaborate and weirdly erotic blood oath routine with him which involved slicing the soles of your feet,
licking the blood, spitting it into each others mouths, and then spitting the mingled blood and saliva back
into the foot wound. He said he saw it on RedTub and thought it seemed cool. For those not in the know, RedTub is the  
sister site to RedTube. RedTub focuses mostly blood play, about which let us say no more because it is dark and unpleasant (yes, kinkshame).</p>
<p>
	Anyway, <b>BARGAIN #2</b>: Satan magic'd away all signs and symptoms of your Herpes... but made you a carrier for Smallpox, 
	Typhoid Fever, Rabies, Ebola, HIV, and Tuberculosis.

Alone in your shitty sedan you neck a cocktail of your own invention: you call it a White Bronco Simpson because the recipe consists of 
orange juice and goon - and you're drinking it in a car. Other variations include: Bloody Simpson (in the 
case where you used red wine) and Brown Simpson (if you mix goon and chocolate milk). Really anything edgy and 
stupid to do with OJ Simpson. At 10:59pm you check your lipstick in the rear view mirror, hoik up your breof your own invention: you call it a White Bronco Simpson because the recipe consists of
