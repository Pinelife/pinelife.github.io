Before getting down to business you spend three minutes searching your desk drawers for snacks. Having found a packet of roasted 
  and salted pistachios, you chew through the nuts, spitooing the shells into the gap behind your desk as you go.

 i no how this is going 2 sound (demented) but i can't help it - im going insane from jealousy. my high school boyfriend was recently 
  charged in relation 2 a string of murders which occurred in our home town. when i say string of murders what i mean is that he is a serial killer.
  he serially killed people. all the girls he killed were dark haired lean little gazelles with tanned skin + glossy side parts. 
 the police r still pulling their bodies out of the creeks, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, dams, channels, lagoons, 
  reservoirs, gorges, weirs, inlets, fjords, estuaries, and canals - he basically dumped 1 in every body of water we have.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
so the first boy i ever loved is a necrophiliac + ur prolly thinking
  how sad i must be that the guy who taught me 2 kiss has expended so much time + energy over the corpses of a bunch of dead girls but never
  bothered 2 wish me happy bday on facebook - which sure yes that sucks. but whats really getting me is that he clearly had a 
 type - all of the girls he killed were tanned + dark haired. im pale + freckled. im 30. its killing me knowing that i wasnt his type. 
  that he wouldnt want me now. he was my first everything + i feel humiliated that i wasnt an object of fascination for him the way 
  he was for me. i no how insane this is that im upset because he probably didnt want 2 murder me. is this just my weird 
  way of processing shock + grief or am i actually this self absorbed + insecure?

  Hey Jealous Readhead, <br/>
   <br/>
  Yes, you are selfish. You aren't the only one who lost a high school sweetheart. People have lost their daughters: there are girls 
  who died horrible deaths and whose bodies may never be found. Your ex raped them and animals ate them and left their bones at the bottom of the lake.
  Mothers will grow old early and never know what happened to their baby girl. Dads will never sleep well ever 
  again. Brothers will get bad tattoos of their faces or birth dates to honour their memory. Christmas will never be the same. 
</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  But I also relate - probably lots of people reading this did. It's not that you wanted to be 
  murdered (or, if you do, that's your own business). Everyone has insecurities - this is maybe the extreme version of being a white guy 
  and finding out that your girlfriend only watches Asian porn. It would hurt: you want the person you love to be attracted to you. 
  You want them to think about you the way you think about them. 
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  I have one consolation: if you aren't his physical type but he still took the time to date you, there must be some pretty great things
  about you. Or maybe he was just desperate and couldn't find anyone else - what do I know? 
  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">
  Have a great weekend everyone!
</p>
<p>Out the corner of your eye you see Ben's girlfriend Francesca trying to creep down the hallway past your room. She's carrying
  her shoes in her hands. She stares determinedly at the the markings on the floorboards: like a booby trapped cave in 
  an <i>Elder Scrolls</i> game, the squeaky floorboards are marked with stickers which she tries to avoid as she sneaks
  down the corridor. Ben has probably told her about the argument you had over her douche wash. You should say something.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
  Hey Franky - did you get up to much last night?
</p>
<p>
  She is instantly suspicious. <span class="Franky">Why?</span>
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
No reason. I got back pretty late and Ben was still up.
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  So?
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
  I thought you guys might have been having an <i>IRT</i> marathon or something.
  </p>
<p>
  Warily she asks: <span class="Franky">What's <i>IRT</i>?</span>
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
  <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>, you know, that show about the guys who drive over frozen lakes in Canada.<br/>
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  Why would we watch that?
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
  Ben never told you? He's a hardcore fan. He's travelled to the US for the last 5 years to go to <i>IRT</i> Con. He's got 
  every season on DVD <i>and</i> Blu-ray. We don't even own a Blu-ray player. He's a complete devotee. Did you never wonder why he always 
  wears trucker hats?
</p>
<p>
  She doesn't say anything.
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
  You guys have been dating for - what - like 6 months now? I wonder why he never...
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  He's never said anything about trucks. He told me he didn't even like TV.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
Aren't you guys planning a trip to Canada together? Do you think - I mean, is it possible...
</p>
<p class="Franky">
He said we would go skiing.</p>
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
Franky, Ben's never skied in his life.
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
Oh god.
 </p>
<p class="lauria">
  I'm not one to give relationship advice but, you know, this seems like a pretty huge betrayal. To keep such a huge part of 
  his life from you, for basically no reason. Really makes you wonder what else he might have kept from you.</p>
  <p>
  She sniffles.
</p>
<p class="lauria">
  This is so much to process - I mean, do you think he ever meant to take you skiing? Or - 
  </p>
<p>
  She chokes on her tears.
  </p> 
<p class="lauria">
  - or did he just want to drive on those ice roads?
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  Oh god, Allison.
  </p>
<p class="lauria">
  What are you going to do?
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  I don't know - do you think I should try to talk to him? I wouldn't even know what to say.
  </p>
<p>
  You nod sagely.
  </p>
<p class="Franky">
  I mean, would this be a deal breaker for you?</p>
  <p class="lauria">
   Is that a joke? He's a liar - and he has terrible taste in TV shows. Do you really want to be with someone who would treat you this way, someone who would take
  you to Canada under the pretence of a ski trip but is actually just taking you driving on ice roads? Franky, do you really think he 
  deserves a second chance?</p>
  <p class="Franky">
I don't know. What do I do?</p>
  <p class="lauria">
  The biggest show of strength would be to be gone when he comes home. Make him stew and reflect on his failings. He
  can work for it if he wants your forgiveness.</p>
  <p>
  She's still sniffling but she nods.
  
  </p>
<p>And so another happy relationship is ruined by <i>Ice Road Truckers</i>. She packs up her things and you have your space
in the bathroom back. When Ben gets home from work he doesn't speak to you and you don't say anything. Throughout the house,
the things Franky forgot to pack echo calamitously with memories: a hair tie on the coffee table, her underwear on the washing line, 
a packet of moldy tofu in the fridge.
