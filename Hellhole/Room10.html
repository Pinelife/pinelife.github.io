    <b>The Story So Far...</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You got dolled up to go to a house party</li>
      </br>
  <li>You struck a Faustian bargain with Satan which (so far) hasn't led to any issues</i></li>
  </br>
 <li>You run a relationship advice blog called Fucklyf</i></li>
  </br>
<li>Your housemate is addicted to <i>Ice Road Truckers</i></li>
  </br>
<li>You guys don't get on because he's been trying to covertly move his girlfriend into the house</i></li>
<br/>
<li>You pitched your all-Asian porn studio at a house party</li>
  </br>
<li>You were too much of a pussy to hit on Chen Li (a long time subject of your affection) and have gone home alone</li>
  </br>
<li>You fell asleep by the light of your laptop and awoke, overwhelmed with self-disgust, elbow deep in an enormous bag of potato chips</li>
</br>
<li>You've ruined your housemate's relationship and now you've gone out to drink alone</li>
</ul>
    </p>
</div>
<p>
	Because of your bargain with Satan, you sit in your car across the road from the Stump Hotel waiting for 11pm.</p>
<p><b>Need a Satanic bargain reminder?</b></p>
<p>Satan promised that you'd always be the smartest, funniest, most interesting girl at any party you go to 
- but in exchange you can't ever get to a party before 11pm by which point everyone is already drunk and immune to things like 
cleverness, so  you receive no discernible performance enhancement. Even Satan isn't totally clear on how this deal is 
actually enforced on Earth: as soon as you decide to go to a party, do more beautiful/funny/smart women decide <i>not</i> 
to go? Do they all leave at 10:55pm before you cross the threshold? Do they lose points as you enter? Do you receive 
some kind of buff?</p>
<p>To seal the deal, Satan made you perform an elaborate and weirdly erotic blood oath routine with him which involved slicing the soles 
of your feet, licking the blood, spitting it into each others mouths, and then spitting the mingled blood and saliva back into the foot 
wound. He said he saw it on RedTub and found it hot but his girlfriend wouldn't try it out with him.
For those not in the know, RedTub is the sister site to RedTube. RedTub's primary market is vampires and their content focuses almost 
exclusively on blood play, about which let us say no more because it is dark and unpleasant (yes, kinkshame).</p>
<p>	
Alone in your shitty sedan you neck a cocktail of your own invention: you call it a White Bronco Simpson because the recipe consists of 
orange juice and goon - and you're drinking it in a car. Other variations include: Bloody Simpson (in the 
case where you used red wine) and Brown Simpson (if you mix goon and chocolate milk). Really anything edgy and 
stupid to do with OJ Simpson. At 10:59pm you check your lipstick in the rear view mirror, hoik up your breof your own invention: you call it a White Bronco Simpson because the recipe consists of 
orange juice and goon - and you're drinking it in a car. Other variations include: Bloody Simpson (in the 
case where you used red wine) and Brown Simpson (if you mix goon and chocolate milk). Really anything edgy and 
stupid to do with OJ Simpson. It's worth mentioning that going to a dive bar alone hardly counts as attending a party - but 
you feel compelled to wait till 11pm anyway. At 10:59pm you check your lipstick in the rear view mirror, hoik up your bra and 
get out of the car.

<p>
In the bar you order a martini so dirty that the bartender just adds three shots of vodka to a jar of olives. Drink in hand, you decide 
to do some work on FuckLyf.

Hey Lauria,<br/>

	<br/>

	I am a prominent figure in the media. In the next week a story will be published about me revealing my sordid history of 

	sexually assaulting and harrassing my delicious, nubile, lovely colleagues... even just thinking about them now... the way their

	eager, young faces crumpled into uncertainty and confusion every time I wiggled my finger through the gap between the buttons 

	in their blouses, every time I - but enough about that.<br/>

	<br/>

	As a member of the media, I want to release a well written mea culpa so as to impress my peers so that even though they might think,

	'oh jeez it is terrible that so-and-so did that to those puffy-lipped, pouty interns - especially the buxom ones, luminous in the 

	bloom of youth ahem uh yes very unprofessional what he did - I'm glad someone has brought him to justice', etc. they will also 

	be quietly impressed by my prose, and, in a dusty corner of their mind, think, 'I can't wait to read what so-and-so writes next. 

	What a powerful and unique voice. Yes, he mercilessly tweaked the nipples of those poor interns, but it's hard not to when their flesh is so firm in comparison

	to our droopy old wives, why I myself...', etc. You get the idea. <br/>

	<br/>

	Needless to say, this means the phrase "I am very sorry for any hurt I may have caused" is totally out. Every Hollywood predator 

	has said this. Though my crime is the same as theirs, I want my apology to ring out across the world as the apotheosis

	of apologetic writing. What would you advise?<br/>

	<br/>

	Regards,<br/>

	A Very Important Pervert

</p>

  My man, <br/>

   <br/>

	I'm sure we've all read enough thinkpieces on <i>Slate</i> and <i>The Atlantic</i> (or at least scanned the titles as we scrolled at record speed down our

	timelines) to know that what you did is wrong and that you should feel bad while we all get to feel superior because none of us has ever

	licked an intern's glossy neck as she crawled around under our desk trying to find the ethernet cable we hid up our trouser leg.

	We can all see that you are about to go down. The world is going to tear you apart like fresh bread. Your wife

	will turn to ash, LinkedIn will delete your profile so as not to be contaminated by your miasma, your kids will get plastic surgery to 

	disguise any facial features that remind them of you, your car will pour sugar into its own petrol tank so you never touch its 

	steering wheel again.<br/>

	<br/>

	Given that there's nothing you can say to prevent this, you lean into it. Here's a sampler:<br/>

	<br/><i>

	The stench of jism and whiskey wafts across the open plan office. Straighten your skirt.

	Fold your arms over your breasts. Look determinedly at your screen. 

	Try not to think of me. For it is I, your boss, and I am come to sexually gratify myself at your expense.<br/>

	<br/>

	Yes, I am drunk at work. Yes, I haven't shaved in four days. Yes, I slept in my car last night. 

	Yes, my PA had to give me a bump of speed during a commercial break so that I could keep my eyes

	open during this morning's broadcast. And now you will let me put my hand on your knee.<br/>

	<br/>

	Either way, your heart races. Either way, your toes curl in your shoes. Either way,

	you dream about me. Either way, you tremble when you remember what I did.

	Men: lock up your wives, sisters, mothers, daughters, and dogs - here's my updated resume:<br/>

	<br/>

		- I'm 54<br/>

		- I can fuck seven times in a night<br/>

		- I'm not done yet<br/>

	<br/>

	</i></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify" class="indented">

	That's all I got.<br/><br/>

	Pls update us - I'm keen to see how this shakes out. I know I'm not the only one who felt more attracted to Harvey

	Weinstein after the allegations: your career may be fucked but I predict that your sex life is gonna be on the ups after this.

	<br/>

	<br/>

	Lauria

<p>The bar is closing. Where are you gonna go now? You can <a href = "Room13.html">drunkenly stumble out into the car park and 
	hope nothing terrible happens to you</a> or you can risk it all, fling yourself through the gate to Oblivion, and enjoy <a href ="excitingevent2.html">a contextless exciting event</a>.
